    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Early Life</h2>
    <p>
      Joseph Smith was born on December 23, 1805, in Sharon, Vermont, USA. Raised in a farming family, he experienced religious revivals and fervor during the "Second Great Awakening" period.

  <section>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Religious Experiences</h2>
    <p>
      In 1820, Smith reported a theophany known as the "First Vision," claiming God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to him. This event became foundational for the LDS Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1823, Smith said an angel named Moroni directed him to golden plates containing the Book of Mormon, which he translated and published in 1830.

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Founding of the LDS Church</h2>
    <p>
      On April 6, 1830, Joseph Smith officially organized The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He led the Church through migrations and growth despite persecution.

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Controversial Teachings and Practices</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
      <li>Polygamy: Smith introduced plural marriage, which was practiced secretly during his life.</li>
      <li>Temple Ordinances: Smith established sacred ceremonies including the endowment.</li>
      <li>Prophecies: He claimed revelations guiding Church governance and doctrine.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Death and Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      Joseph Smith was killed by a mob in Carthage, Illinois, in 1844 while jailed on charges related to the destruction of a printing press critical of him. His death led to succession struggles and the eventual migration of many members west to Utah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, Smith remains a deeply revered figure in the LDS Church, while critics question aspects of his character and history.
