    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Why this, Friiskers?</h2>
 <p>Too many times have I been burnt when I turnt to either side to ask questions, yet I persisted to do so. It's common practice within the LDS church to share a 'testimony' and I do believe that it's only fair for myself to do so. Only difference is, I pride myself on transparency and research, and with the help of some fantastic people, and with AI for the coding side, I've been able to slap together this for your viewing.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
 <p> Now, obviously I am not going to fully dox myself over the internet, however I will share this. As of writing this (June 30th, 2025), I have been on-off going to the LDS church in my hometown for a little over 6 months. I was baptized and made a member in said church in March 2025, and have been trying to find my own way to connect with spirituality ever since.</p>
 </section>
 <section>
     <p> This is my way of attempting to give people an overview, an attempt to spark conversation, an attempt to bridge a gap between both sides of the coin. I don't believe that it's in anyone's genuine best interest to alienate the other side completely, and though dialogue won't be able to fix everything, it can be a jump in a direction that will allow for some resemblence of respect. </p>
     </section>
     <section>
         <p>There's alot of bad shit going on in the world, I don't see a reason to add to it more then neccessary. However, I feel the need to send my condolences to the victims who share their stories, both within and outside the church. This is your reminder that your experiences and feelings are valid, no matter what anyone says.</p>
