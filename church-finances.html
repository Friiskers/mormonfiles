    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The financial operations of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) involve substantial income from member donations (tithing), investments, business ventures, and real estate holdings. 
      Transparency regarding the Church’s finances has been a topic of debate both inside and outside the Church community.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Sources of Income</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
      <li><strong>Tithing:</strong> Members voluntarily donate 10% of their income, forming the Church’s primary revenue source.</li>
      <li><strong>Investment Portfolio:</strong> The Church manages diversified assets through the Church Investment Fund, including stocks, bonds, and private equity.</li>
      <li><strong>Real Estate and Businesses:</strong> The Church owns extensive real estate, including temples, meetinghouses, farms, and commercial properties. It also owns companies like Deseret Management Corporation.</li>
      <li><strong>Other Donations:</strong> Members give to humanitarian and educational funds.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Use of Funds</h2>
    <p>The Church states funds are primarily used for:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
      <li>Building and maintaining temples and meetinghouses worldwide.</li>
      <li>Supporting missionary programs and humanitarian aid.</li>
      <li>Providing education through Church-owned universities and seminaries.</li>
      <li>General operating expenses of the Church’s global programs.</li>
      <li>Investments aimed at long-term sustainability.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Faithful Perspectives</h2>
    <p>
      Church members generally see tithing as a spiritual commandment and an act of faith. They believe funds are used responsibly to further the Church’s religious mission and charitable works.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Church periodically publishes reports about humanitarian efforts and building projects but does not disclose full financial statements publicly.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Critical Perspectives</h2>
    <p>
      Critics point to the Church’s immense wealth—estimated in the tens of billions of dollars—and limited financial transparency as problematic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Investigations and reports, such as a 2019 article in <em>The Guardian</em>, revealed substantial real estate holdings and investments. Skeptics argue that members should be given more financial disclosure to understand how tithing is used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some claim the Church’s wealth contrasts with its teachings on modesty and charity.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Conclusions</h2>
    <p>
      LDS Church finances represent a complex balance between religious donations, business management, and investment strategy. Transparency remains a significant area of discussion both inside and outside the Church.
