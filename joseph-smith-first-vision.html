    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The First Vision is the foundational event for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), wherein Joseph Smith claimed God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to him as a young teenager in 1820.
      This event initiated the restoration of what LDS members believe is the original Christian church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph Smith recounted multiple versions of this vision between 1832 and 1844, with some variations in details. This has led to significant scholarly debate about the nature and historicity of the event.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Joseph Smith’s Accounts of the First Vision</h2>
    <p>The four main accounts are:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
      <li><strong>1832 Account:</strong> The earliest, written in Joseph’s own hand, emphasizes his search for forgiveness of sins and a vision of Jesus alone.</li>
      <li><strong>1835 Account:</strong> Includes a vision of both God the Father and Jesus Christ, with emphasis on the presence of angels.</li>
      <li><strong>1838 Account:</strong> The official account canonized in LDS scripture, emphasizing the rejection of all existing churches.</li>
      <li><strong>1842 Account:</strong> Known as the “Wentworth Letter,” a more concise version summarizing the event for a broader audience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These differing accounts show a core narrative but also changes in emphasis, context, and theological interpretation over time.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Faithful Perspectives</h2>
    <p>
      Apologists and faithful LDS scholars often explain the differences as natural for a complex, deeply personal spiritual experience told at different times, influenced by the audience and Smith’s growth in understanding.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-400 pl-4 italic my-4">
      “Differences in retellings are consistent with normal memory evolution, especially with spiritual experiences,” says LDS historian Richard L. Bushman (in <em>Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling</em>, 2005).
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The core doctrine—that God and Jesus appeared and instructed Joseph Smith to restore true Christianity—is unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The First Vision is seen as a uniquely foundational event restoring priesthood authority and divine revelation after a Great Apostasy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Critical Perspectives</h2>
    <p>
      Critics argue the discrepancies undermine the credibility of the event. They note that Smith only began publicizing the vision widely years after it allegedly occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some point out the lack of contemporary documentation, as well as contradictions between accounts about whether Smith saw one person or two, the presence of angels, and the exact message given.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historian Dan Vogel, in <em>Joseph Smith: The Making of a Prophet</em> (2004), suggests the First Vision was a later theological construct, influenced by the religious revival context.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, some Christian critics reject the idea of God appearing as two separate beings, as the First Vision suggests.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Conclusions</h2>
    <p>
      Joseph Smith’s First Vision remains central to LDS theology and identity, symbolizing the restoration of true doctrine.
    </p>
    <p>
      While faithful members accept the vision as genuine and inspired, historical-critical methods highlight inconsistencies and lack of early evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding these perspectives helps members and non-members approach the LDS faith with transparency and intellectual openness.
